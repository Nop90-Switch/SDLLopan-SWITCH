Within the game, <ESCAPE> exits, and <RETURN> reshuffles the board.
The arrow keys work as undo/redo.

F1 switches the tilesets, the data/tiles#.pcx files are used.
F2 switched the background, the data/bg#.pcx files are used.
In both cases, number files from 0.

The game requires the SDL library to run. That is available from
http://www.devolution.com/~slouken/projects/SDL/
You may need to tinker with the Makefile to get it to compile...

To save disk space you can delete the data/bg*.pcx files you don't want,
then renumber them starting from 0.
